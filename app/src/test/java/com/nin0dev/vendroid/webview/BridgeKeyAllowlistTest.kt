/**
 * Pins the bridge settings-key allowlist ([VencordNative.isBridgeKeyAllowed])
 * against the keys the eq.js settings tree renders. Unprefixed tree keys used
 * to fail this gate: reads returned the default, writes were dropped, and
 * toggles flipped in the UI without ever persisting.
 *
 * Dispositions:
 *  - desktopMode: allowed and consumed natively at startup; its Boolean type
 *    mirror is pinned in BridgeSettingTypeContractTest.
 *  - checkVDEUpdates, clientMod: allowed. checkVDEUpdates is read by the
 *    updater tab; clientMod is value-validated in setString.
 *  - checkAnnouncements: allowed but currently unread. Kept for upstream,
 *    and type-guarded meanwhile.
 *  - vencordLocation: rejected. It selects the code the app downloads and
 *    executes, so page JS must never write it.
 *  - splashScreen, discordBranch, allowRemoteDebugging: blocked. Nothing
 *    native consumes them, so HttpClient prunes them from the tree at
 *    download time. The gate keeps blocking them so a re-addition cannot
 *    quietly become another dead toggle.
 *
 * When the eq.js tree gains a key, decide and record its disposition here:
 * allowed, or deliberately blocked.
